    "The player tosses a coin repeatedly until a tail appears or tosses it a maximum of 1000 times if no tail appears. The initial stake starts at 2 dollars and is doubled every time heads appears. The first time tails appears, the game ends and the player wins whatever is in the pot. Thus the player wins 2 dollars if tails appears on the first toss, 4 dollars if heads appears on the first toss and tails on the second, 8 dollars if heads appears on the first two tosses and tails on the third, and so on. Mathematically, the player wins $2^k$ dollars, where k equals the number of tosses until the first tail.\n",
