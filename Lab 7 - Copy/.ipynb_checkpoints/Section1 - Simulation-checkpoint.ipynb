    "Simulation is the process of generating new data. In many situations, it is difficult to examine the probability or estimate a the parameter inside the probability model, such as the mean and variance. While we can't mathematically prove that a value is true, simulation allows us to predict the probability of different outcomes of the model when randomness is present. Simulation, or Monte Carlo simulation, is very important in the field of applied statistics to understand the parameters behind the model."
